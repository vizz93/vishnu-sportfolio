										<h2>So what's this?</h2>
										<p>
											Picture this: Now you’re a floor supervisor at a buzzing gaming venue. Slots are spinning, cards are flying, and people are having the time of their lives. Then—bam!—an incident happens. Maybe a machine malfunctions, or a customer dispute breaks out. You’re in the thick of it, trying to log everything accurately without disrupting the action or losing precious time. Sounds hectic, right?
Enter this Incident Logging & Reporting Tool—a lifesaver for supervisors like you. With just a few taps on your mobile, you can record all the details and get back to managing the floor. And for managers? The web dashboard is like a command center for tracking and analyzing incidents over time, helping make the venue safer, smoother, and smarter.

										</p>
										
										<h2>The problem</h2>
										<ul>
											<p>
												Supervisors need to log incidents fast, without losing control of the floor. But traditional methods—pen and paper or clunky software—are slow, inefficient, and prone to errors. Managers, meanwhile, are stuck with incomplete data and no easy way to spot trends or track resolutions. In short, the system wasn’t working for anyone.
											</p>
										</ul>
										
										<h2>The solution</h2>
										<p>This tool was designed to make incident management as seamless as possible.
											</p>
											<div>
												<p><strong>Mobile Incident Logging:</strong> A quick, form-based interface lets supervisors log incidents in real time, complete with timestamps and attachments. No more fumbling around—just tap, save, and go.</p>
												<p><strong>Incident Categorization:</strong> Tag incidents by type, urgency, or location for easy tracking and filtering.</p>
												<p><strong>Real-Time Dashboard:</strong> Managers get a bird’s-eye view of all incidents on a slick, web-based dashboard with summaries, filters, and deep-dive options.</p>
												<p><strong>Automated Alerts:</strong> Critical incidents trigger instant notifications, so the right people can act immediately.</p>
												<p><strong>Detailed Reporting Tools:</strong> Generate and export reports to track trends, measure response times, and make data-driven decisions.</p>
												<p><strong>Cross-Platform Syncing:</strong> All your data updates in real time across mobile and web—no gaps, no delays.</p>
											  </div>
										
										<h2>The design magic</h2>
										<p>This isn’t just functional—it’s designed to make your life easier:
										</p>
										<div>
											<p><strong>Quick-Entry Mobile Interface:</strong> Large buttons, minimal fields, and touch-friendly design for stress-free data entry on a busy floor.</p>
											<p><strong>Data Visualizations:</strong> Charts and trends on the dashboard help managers spot patterns and address recurring issues.</p>
											<p><strong>Intuitive Filters:</strong> Sort incidents by time, severity, or type to find what matters most, fast.</p>
											<p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Works seamlessly on any device—mobile, tablet, or desktop.</p>
											<p><strong>Accessibility First:</strong> Built to be usable by everyone, with clear contrast, readable fonts, and keyboard navigability.</p>
										  </div>
										  

										<div class="work-img">

											</div>


										<h2>The results</h2>
										<p>
											The tool transformed incident management:
										</p>
										<div>
											<p><strong>For supervisors:</strong> Logging incidents became 30% faster, giving them more time to focus on keeping the floor running smoothly.</p>
											<p><strong>For managers:</strong> Response times dropped by 25%, and proactive issue management became possible thanks to better insights from detailed reports.</p>
											<p><strong>For venues:</strong> Safer, more efficient operations and happier teams.</p>
										  </div>
										  
										
										<h2>The challenges</h2>
										<p>
											Making a tool this effective wasn’t without hurdles. Designing for mobile usability in fast-paced, unpredictable environments required tons of user testing and refinement. But each iteration made it stronger and better.
										</p>
										
										<h2>My role</h2>
											<div>
												<p><strong>User Research:</strong> Spent time with floor supervisors to understand their pain points and workflows.</p>
												<p><strong>Wireframing:</strong> Sketched out the structure of the tool, focusing on ease and efficiency.</p>
												<p><strong>Prototyping:</strong> Built interactive prototypes to test ideas and gather feedback.</p>
												<p><strong>UI/UX Design:</strong> Created polished, responsive interfaces that looked great and worked even better, across devices.</p>
												<p><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Designed charts and visuals that made insights clear at a glance.</p>
												<p><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Worked closely with users to fine-tune every detail.</p>
											  </div>
											  <p>
												This project wasn’t just about building a tool—it was about empowering gaming venues to operate smarter and faster. And honestly? It was pretty awesome to see how much of a difference thoughtful design can make.
